1. An algorithm that O(1) is a formula one racecar and O(2^n) is a Ford Model T.
2. In a binary search, the best case scenario is that the element we are searching for is exactly
in the middle of the array, giving the result in the very first itteration or 0(1).
3. The worst case scenario for a binary search follows the O(log(n)) notation. It's the case where the element is just to 
the side of the very middle element in the array. This means that as number of elements(n)
gets larger, the time it will take is logarithmically proportional to the number of iterations.
4. The bounded, or average case scenario for binary search is on average very close to the worst-case scenario and
is still O(log(n)).
5. The graph is in the folder along with this file.
6. As n approaches infinity, the limit of the function also approaches infinity.
7. The big-O notation for the data is O(2^n).

10. Worst case scenario of binary search is O(log(n))
11. The best case scenario of binary search is Omega(1), as the value would be found right away.
12. The average case scenario is also Theta(log(n)) as the fundemental process is not different than Big Oh, and
the fact that even the worst case performace of binary search is very close to the worst case is a good thing in
this case, considering that log(n) complexity is very efficient.
